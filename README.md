# hapi-reveal

hapi plugin for reveal.js presentations

Note: if you want to see a top level use case for this go to:

https://github.com/lloydbenson/presentations where I utilize it.  For now it just does reveal.js 2.x and you need the whole html file there.  Handlebars working coming later I hope.
