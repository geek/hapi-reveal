# hapi-reveal

hapi plugin for reveal.js presentations

Note: if you want to see a top level use case for this go to:

https://github.com/lloydbenson/presentations where I utilize it.

This now handles 3.x reveal and you can also use partials within your html directory for shared slides (I use whoami and questions as examples).  Enjoy!
